To run the script

1. Download files
2. Extract files
3. Copy the folder where the .csv files you would like to check are stored
4. Run the script

Work:

1. The script will ask you to paste the wolder where your datasets is stored, please, check it suits to example
2. Run the second line to see the plot

Aim:

My aim at making this script was to check which words are most commonly used in different tweets, it can also be used to find out any most common word in any csv files, you can check.

How it can be used:

Now there are different datasets with different tweets stored in the repo, but if you leave only one csv file, you can see, for example, whuch words are used but some of the politicians ot business men, which words are using different nations and etc. This can be fed to neural neutwork to analyse tweets all over the world and, for example, find there only tweets of Elon Musk.
